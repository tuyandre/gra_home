                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4> 1. What is e-invoicing?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Electronic invoicing or e-Invoicing is a system of raising invoices, under which invoices
                        generated by one software can be read by any other software, eliminating the need for any fresh
                        data entry or errors. In simpler words, it is an invoice generated using a standardized format,
                        where the electronic data of the invoice can be shared with others, thus ensuring the
                        interoperability of data. <br>
                        OR Is an electronic invoice generated by a GRA certified Invoicing Software and has a
                        unique electronic signature stamped by the authority security key; this invoice is later
                        reported to GRA backoffice and can be verified by anyone.
                    </p>

                    <h4>2. Is e-invoicing mandatory? To whom will e-invoicing apply?</h4>
                    <p>E-Invoicing is mandatory for all businesses that have been granted dispensation by the
                        Commissioner General to issue their own invoices/receipts. For such businesses to continue to
                        enjoy this dispensation, they will have to integrate their invoicing system to the E-VAT system,
                        Or use it directly.</p>

                    <h4>3. What if I use manual VAT invoicing, does E-VAT still apply to me?</h4>
                    <p>For businesses that operate under the manual VAT invoicing regime, GRA has provided them with a
                        free online and offline invoicing system to use to issue invoices. This software allow such
                        business to have a 360 degree view of their sales and expenses, giving them insights into how
                        their businesses
                        are performing.</p>

                    <h4>4. What are the benefits of e-invoicing?</h4>
                    <p>The E-VAT will provide significant benefits to businesses, such as: </p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>
                            Streamline VAT refund process. Since GRA will have all invoices, time taken to process
                            refunds will be shorter
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reduce cost of compliance to taxpayers  having all invoices issued through the E-VAT system
                            will ensure that you have all invoices stored in the taxpayers portal within the E-Vat
                            system to facilitate VAT Return filing. Taxpayers will under the E_VAT be able to send
                            invoices electronically to another E-VAT registered taxpayer without mailing, printing and
                            postage costs
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fair and equitable VAT regime  Once we have all VAT taxpayers on the E-VAT, the issue of
                            some taxpayers in the same sectors not charging VAT resulting in the increased prices of
                            those charging VAT will be eliminated
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>5. How do I create an electronic invoice using my existing POS or ERP ?
                        What are the supplies currently covered under e-invoicing?</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you currently use a Point of Sale (POS) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, you
                        only need to complete the integration to the VAT system. The GRA technical team will assist you
                        with this process. Once completed, all invoices you issue will be E-VAT certified.

                    </p>

                    <h4>6. Is e-invoicing applicable to zero-rated or wholly-exempt supplies?</h4>
